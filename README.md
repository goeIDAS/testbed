# eIDAS-Testbed
## Goal of the eIDAS-Testbed
The aim of the **[eIDAS-Testbed](https://test.eID.AS)**, which has been launched within the **[OpenID-Wallet-Plugfest (23.-24. May 2024)](https://gaia-x.eu/tech-x-2024/)**, is to push forward the interoperable implementation of [European Digital Identity Wallets](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/EUDIGITALIDENTITYWALLET/EU+Digital+Identity+Wallet+Home) in the sense of Art. 5a [(EU) 2024/1183](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1183/oj) and similar sorts of [Personal](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/xfsc/pcm) or [Organisational](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/xfsc/organisational-credential-manager-w-stack) Credential Managers used in the [Gaia-X](https://gaia-x.eu/) domain
(collectively called “**Wallets**”), which are able to handle [Verifiable Credentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_credentials) according 
to the [W3C Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) using protocols such as [OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html) 
(**OpenID4VCI**) and [OpenID for Verifiable Presentations](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html) (**OpenID4VP**) with a view to the 
current [Architecture Reference Framework](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/blob/main/docs/arf.md) (ARF) and an outlook to application domains,
including the [**Open European Health Data Space**](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/blob/main/docs/arf.md) (EHDS) for example.
